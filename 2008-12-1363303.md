If you have experience with SharePoint 2003, you are most probably in love with the Web Capture Web Part.  
To install this Web Part on WSS 3.0 you need to fiddle around a little. You can't just download the Office Web Parts and Component from MS, because it will complain that you need WSS 2.0 installed to be able to install the file...  
Thanks to [this post](http://msmvps.com/blogs/shane/archive/2006/09/02/How-to-manually-install-the-Office-Web-Parts-in-SharePoint-v3.aspx) on [Shane Young's](http://msmvps.com/blogs/shane/) blog, you can get the Web Capture in SharePoint 2007.  
First of all you need to get a copy of the Office Web Parts (Web Capture) Cab files. If you have the Office Web Parts installed on a V2, you can get the cab file from  
c:\program files\common files\micrsofot shared\web server extensions\60\wppacks  
The cab file which contains the Web Capture file is "microsoft.office.dataparts.cab".  
*Edit: if you don't have the cab files, you can download them from here:*   
<http://www.2shared.com/file/3663746/d9ecea5d/MicrosoftOfficeDataParts.html> (New download link)  
Copy this file to your 2007 installation, put it in an accessible location (C:\spswebparts) and run the following command:  
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\12\BIN\**stsadm -o addwppack -filename "C:\spswebparts\microsoft.office.dataparts.cab" -globalinstall** followed by *iisreset*. Et voila, you can add the Web Capture web part to your web part zones! You should be able to install most Web Parts from 2003 using this method!
