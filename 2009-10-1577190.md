最近在研究K2的工作流平台,其中有一个比较重要的部分是开发自定义服务,让K2能够使用.下面是一些介绍

   
SmartObject Services are the conduit for provisioning data from data sources into SmartObjects.  
A SmartObject Service is simply a class that must override several methods that are K2 blackpearl  
SmartObject server requirements. The implementation of these methods can be simple or complex as  
needed. This section delves in detail on how to create a stub for a SmartObject Service but does not go  
into the details of an actual implementation for getting data from a data source.

 To create a SmartObject Service, first create a code library project in Visual Studio and then add a reference  
to **SourceCode.SmartObjects.Services.ServiceSDK** , which is located in \\Program Files\  
K2 blackpearl\Host Server\Bin\ . Once this library is referenced, right - click the reference in Visual  
Studio Solution Explorer, go to properties of the reference, and change Copy Local property from **True** to  
False, then add a reference to the **System.Transactions** library. Once both of the libraries have been  
added, create a class that inherits from **ServiceAssemblyBase** . There can only be one class of  
ServiceAssemblyBase per code project. All classes that inherit from ServiceAssemblyBase must  
override the following methods: **GetConfigSection() , DescribeSchema() , Execute() , and Extend()** . 简单地说，要继承ServiceAssemblyBase，重写它的四个方法。
