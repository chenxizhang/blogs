全文转载：[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/01xdt7cs(VS.100).aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/01xdt7cs(VS.100).aspx "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/01xdt7cs(VS.100).aspx") The Visual Studio 2010 debugger has been enhanced by the addition of the following features: * Breakpoint enhancements, which include the ability to search in the Breakpoints window, the ability to label breakpoints, the ability to import and export breakpoints, and string comparison for breakpoint conditions in native debugging. **断点方面的增强，支持导入导出断点。 也可以为断点添加标签。** **还可以对断点进行搜索**
+ For more information, see [How to: Search the Breakpoints List](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd293687(VS.100).aspx), [How to: Label Breakpoints](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd293674(VS.100).aspx), and [How to: Import and Export Breakpoints](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd293657(VS.100).aspx).

* WPF debugging enhancements, which include enhanced tracing that you can use to view events in your WPF application. You can use a WPF Tree Visualizer to inspect and search the WPF tree. **进一步增强了对WPF程序的跟踪调试，这首先可以通过订阅某些事件来实现，同时还可以通过一个可视化的工具查看WPF树（逻辑树和视觉树）**

 * A newly redesigned Threads window provides filtering, call-stack searching and expansion, and grouping. New columns display affinity masks, process names, and managed IDs. You can customize which columns appear and in what order. **重新设计的线程窗口**。 For more information, see [How to: Use the Threads Window](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w15yf86f(VS.100).aspx).

 * You can use the Parallel Stacks and Parallel Tasks debugger tool windows to visualize and debug parallel code that is written in C++, C#, or Visual Basic. For information about how to use these tool windows, see [Walkthrough: Debugging a Parallel Application](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd554943(VS.100).aspx). **增强了对并行任务程序的监控，提供了两个窗口来显示有关的信息。**

 * Enhanced DataTips can float on top of other windows or be pinned. DataTips now have a comment field. Floating DataTips that are open persist between debug sessions. For more information, see [How to: Use DataTips](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ea46xwzd(VS.100).aspx). **可以使用所谓的DataTips，记录调试中对于变量的一些描述信息**

 * For dump debugging, a new summary page displays basic information about the contents of the dump file before you start to debug. This page offers quick links to the most common next steps, such as setting your symbol paths and starting to debug. The debugger now fully supports debugging of managed dumps for applications that are using common language-run-time (CLR) version 4.0. For more information, see [Dump Files](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d5zhxt22(VS.100).aspx). **保存调试文件**

 * The Watch window and DataTips provide an icon to warn you when an evaluating an expression requires other threads to run, which can change the program state and cause debug events such as breakpoints to be ignored. If you click the icon, the threads run. For more information, see [How to: Refresh Watch Values](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z4ecfxd9(VS.100).aspx).

 * Enhancements to symbol loading. See [How to: Specify Symbol Locations and Loading Behavior](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x54fht41(VS.100).aspx).

* You can now debug mixed-mode native and managed code on 64-bit operating systems. For more information, see [How to: Debug 64-Bit Applications](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms184681(VS.100).aspx).
