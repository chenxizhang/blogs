Google已经公开了很多的API，具体可以参考 [http://www.googleapi.cn/](http://www.googleapi.cn/ "http://www.googleapi.cn/")。目前大体感觉还是有些乱，我觉得Google也是在测试，不断地调整中 [Google 身份认证接口](http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/Authentication.html) The [ClientLogin API](http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForInstalledApps.html) lets you incorporate programmatic login into desktop or mobile applications, while the [AuthSub API](http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/AuthForWebApps.html) gives web applications the ability to access a user's Google account without handling the user's login information. [广告接口](http://code.google.com/apis/adsense/) The AdSense API enables you to integrate AdSense signup, ad unit management, and reporting into your web or blog hosting platform. You and your users can generate revenue from your users' web content on your website by showing relevant ads, providing web search and referring products. Sample client implementations are available in [Java](http://code.google.com/apis/adsense/developer/adsense_api_samples.html#java_section), [Perl](http://code.google.com/apis/adsense/developer/adsense_api_samples.html#perl_section), [Python](http://code.google.com/apis/adsense/developer/adsense_api_samples.html#python_section), [PHP](http://code.google.com/apis/adsense/developer/adsense_api_samples.html#php_section) and [.NET](http://code.google.com/apis/adsense/developer/adsense_api_samples.html#cs_section). [关键字接口](http://www.google.com/apis/adwords/) Google's free AdWords API service lets developers engineer computer programs that interact directly with the AdWords server. With the applications created, advertisers and third parties can more efficiently - and creatively - manage their large AdWords accounts and campaigns. Additionally, we are pleased to offer a [PHP](http://google-apility.sourceforge.net/) and [Java](http://goog-ad-api-cli.sourceforge.net//) Client API implementation. [Google AJAX 搜索接口](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/) The AJAX Search API is an experimental API that lets you integrate a dynamic Google search module into your web pages so your users can mash up Google search results with other content on your site or add search results clippings to their own content. [Google 基本数据接口](http://code.google.com/apis/base/) The Google Base data API allows client applications to view and update stored data in the form of Google data API ("GData") feeds. Your client application can use the Google Base data API to create new data, edit or delete existing data, and query for data items that match particular criteria. [Blogger 数据接口](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/blogger.html) The Blogger data API allows client applications to view and update Blogger content in the form of Google data API ("GData") feeds. Your client application can use GData to create new blog posts, edit or delete existing posts, and query for posts that match particular criteria. [Google 日历接口](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/calendar.html) The Google Calendar API allows client applications to view and update calendar events in the form of Google data API ("GData") feeds. Your client application can use the Google Calendar data API to create new events, edit or delete existing events, and query for events that match particular criteria. [Google 数据接口](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/index.html) The Google data APIs ("GData" for short) provide a simple standard protocol for reading and writing data on the web. GData combines common XML-based syndication formats (Atom and RSS) with a feed-publishing system based on the Atom publishing protocol, plus some extensions for handling queries. The current services supported by Google data APIs include: [Blogger](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/blogger.html), [Google Base](http://code.google.com/apis/base) and [Google Calendar](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/calendar.html) [Google 桌面 SDK](http://desktop.google.com/developer.html) The Google Desktop SDK empowers software developers to integrate GD into their own applications, add new file formats for GD to index and create Sidebar panels. We also offer an [example](http://sourceforge.net/projects/goog-kongulo/), written in [Python](http://www.python.org/), to show you how to do it. [Google 地球地标](http://earth.google.com/kml/) KML (Keyhole Markup Language) is a grammar and file format for modeling and storing geographic features such as points, lines, images and polygons for display in the Google Earth Client. KML gives you the ability to do amazing things with Google Earth. Also check out the [tutorial and documentation](http://earth.google.com/kml/) and the [Keyhole BBS](http://bbs.keyhole.com/). [Google Gadgets 接口](http://www.google.com/apis/homepage) If you'd like to create modules for the Google [personalized homepage](http://www.google.com/ig), there is a way for you to do just that. There is also a Google group set up for those who'd like to create new modules. You can also check out the [module directory](http://www.google.com/ig/directory) that includes some modules the team created to help get the ball rolling. [Gmail Atom Feeds](http://gmail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=13465) Gmail offers its users a simple feed mechanism for reading your inbox or your labels via any aggregator that supports the Atom XML feed format. [Google 支付接口](http://code.google.com/apis/checkout) The Google Checkout API enables merchants to [integrate](http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/index.html#technical_introduction) their existing e-commerce systems with Google Checkout, communicate [order status](http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/index.html#order_processing_api) to buyers, and take advantage of [advanced functionality](http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/developer/index.html#custom_calc_api) offered by the service. Sample [client implementations](http://code.google.com/apis/checkout/samplecode.html) are currently available in Java, PHP, and Classic ASP. [Google Web 工具集](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) Google Web Toolkit (GWT) is a Java software development framework that makes writing AJAX applications easy. With GWT, you can develop and debug AJAX applications in the Java language using the Java development tools of your choice. When you deploy your application to production, the GWT compiler translates your Java application to browser-compliant JavaScript and HTML. [Google Groups Feeds](http://groups.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=12388) Did you know that Groups publishes a feed for every group in the system? Now you do. There is a good user created guide to their use [here](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2004/05/google_groups_2.html) as well, thanks Nick Bradbury! [Google 地图接口](http://www.google.com/apis/maps/) 将google 地图部署在你自己的网站上，可以添加放大缩小和加标注路线等等功能。 [Google News Feeds](http://news.google.com/intl/en_us/news_feed_terms.html) Google offers both Atom and RSS feeds for news. Users can subscribe to both topic and news search feeds. [Google 相关链接](http://www.google.com/relatedlinks/) Google Related Links use the power of Google to automatically bring fresh, dynamic and interesting content links to any website. You can place these units on your site to provide visitors with links to useful information related to the site's content, including relevant news, searches, and web pages. [Google Search Appliance APIs](http://code.google.com/enterprise/) The Google Search Appliance [Search Protocol](http://code.google.com/enterprise/documentation/xml_reference.html) is a simple HTTP-based protocol for serving search results. Search administrators have complete control over how search results are requested and presented to end users. The Google Search Appliance [Feeds Protocol](http://code.google.com/enterprise/documentation/feedsguide.html) allows a customer or a third-party developer to write a custom connector to feed a data source into the Google Search Appliance for processing, indexing, and serving. The Google Search Appliance [Authorization Protocol](http://code.google.com/enterprise/documentation/authn_authz_spi.html) allows a customer's web service to authorize users to access specific documents for searching in real-time, leveraging their existing security and access control environment. [Google Search History Feeds](http://www.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=38344) Personalized Search users can get an RSS feed of their Search History, including their recent searches and clicks on Google Web Search, News, Froogle and more. [Google Sitemaps](http://www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps/docs/en/about.html) Google Sitemaps is an experiment in web crawling. Using Sitemaps to inform and direct our crawlers, we hope to expand our coverage of the web and improve the time to inclusion in our index. By placing a Sitemap-formatted file on your webserver, you enable our crawlers to find out what pages are present and which have recently changed, and to crawl your site accordingly. We have an open-source [project](http://goog-sitemapgen.sourceforge.net/) that helps in the creation of these sitemaps, and there are many [third party Sitemap tools](http://code.google.com/sm_thirdparty.html) available. [Google Talk XMPP](http://code.google.com/apis/talk/talk_developers_home.html) Talk uses [XMPP](http://www.xmpp.org/) for its communications protocol. The team has put together a [document](http://code.google.com/apis/talk/open_communications.html) outlining how to use a standard Jabber client to communicate with Google Talk. This makes for a very nice programmatic interface for IM. Google also offers Libjingle, a set of C++ components to interoperate with Google Talk's peer-to-peer and voice calling capabilities. For details, see the [Libjingle Developer Guide](http://code.google.com/apis/talk/about.html). There are multiple interfaces in a great variety of languages including [python](http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/), [PHP](http://cjphp.netflint.net/), [Java](http://www.jivesoftware.org/smack/) and [C#](http://www.cursive.net/jabber-net/). The [Jabber Software Foundation](http://www.jabber.org/) maintains a healthy list of [libraries](http://www.jabber.org/software/libraries.shtml) on their site. We hope you enjoy our developer friendly Talk. [Google 工具条接口](http://www.google.com/tools/toolbar/buttons/apis/) The Google Toolbar API lets you create custom buttons for the Google Toolbar (version 4 and above) using XML. Buttons can navigate to and search a site, display an RSS feed in a menu, and change their icon dynamically. [Google SOAP Search 接口](http://code.google.com/apis/soapsearch/) With the Google Web APIs service, software developers can query billions of web pages directly from their own computer programs. The Google web search API uses the SOAP and WSDL standards.   下面地址是专门针对GData API的 [http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/ "http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/") #### What are the Google Data APIs?

 The Google Data APIs provide a simple standard protocol for reading and writing Data on the web. These APIs use either of two standard XML-based syndication formats: Atom or RSS. They also have a feed-publishing system that consists of the Atom publishing protocol plus some extensions (using Atom's standard extension model) for handling queries. Many Google services support the [Google Data API protocol](http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/overview.html). The following Data APIs allow your client applications to interact with Google services: * [Google Apps APIs](http://code.google.com/apis/apps/)* [Google Base Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/base/)* [Blogger Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/blogger/)* [Google Calendar Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/)* [Google Code Search Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/codesearch/)* [Google Contacts Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/contacts/)* [Google Finance Portfolio Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/finance/)* [Google Health Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/health/)* [Google Notebook Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/notebook/)* [Google Spreadsheets Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/spreadsheets/)* [Picasa Web Albums Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/picasaweb/)* [Google Documents List Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/documents/)* [Webmaster Tools Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/webmastertools/)* [YouTube Data API](http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/)
